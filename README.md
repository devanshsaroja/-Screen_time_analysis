# Screen Time App Analysis

This project analyzes user engagement with various applications based on their screen time, notifications received, and times opened over a specified period. The analysis is visualized using interactive plots created with Plotly.

## Introduction

In today's digital age, understanding how users interact with applications is crucial for developers and marketers. This analysis provides insights into app usage patterns, the impact of notifications on user engagement, and how often users open apps.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `Screentime-App-Details-Dataset.csv`, which contains the following columns:

- **Date**: The date of recording.
- **App**: The name of the application.
- **Usage**: Total screen time spent on the app (in minutes).
- **Notifications**: Number of notifications received from the app.
- **Times opened**: How many times the app was opened.

## Visualization

The following visualizations were created to analyze user behavior:

1. **App Usage Over Time**: A bar plot showing total screen time for each app over the specified dates.
